# Settings

This is the code area for Workstation's Settings Component.

The component provides detailed settings or information for things like Wifi,
Bluetooth, and build information. The code here is primarily deprecated and
ported from other repositiories, it is not expected to be functional outside of
rendering.

Settings will be updated with a simpler component that visually matches the the
rest of Workstation at some point in the future, follow fxb/45551 for
details/status.
