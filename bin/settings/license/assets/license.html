      BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL<br />licensing. Files that are
      completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC<br />license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this
      file.<br /><br />Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for
      Chromium:<br />https://cla.developers.google.com/clas<br /><br />Files in third_party/ have their own licenses, as
      described therein. The MIT<br />license, for third_party/fiat, which, unlike other third_party directories,
      is<br />compiled into non-test libraries, is included below.<br /><br />The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual
      license, i.e. both the conditions of the<br />OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the
      toolkit. See below<br />for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open
      Source<br />licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please

      are as<br />follows. First, we will summarize and say that all components<br />are under a BSD licence, or a
      licence more free than that.<br /><br />OpenSSH contains no GPL code.<br /><br />1)<br /> * Copyright (c) 1995
      Tatu Ylonen &lt;ylo@cs.hut.fi&gt;, Espoo, Finland<br /> * All rights reserved<br /> *<br /> * As far as I am
      concerned, the code I have written for this software<br /> * can be used freely for any purpose. Any derived
      versions of this<br /> * software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is<br /> * incompatible
      with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be<br /> * called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure
      Shell".<br /><br /> [Tatu continues]<br /> * However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents
      or<br /> * copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that<br /> * are not under my direct
      control. As far as I know, all included<br /> * source code is used in accordance with the relevant license
      agreements<br /> * and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most<br /> * restrictive);
      see below for details.<br /><br /> [However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time. All of<br />
      these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about<br /> have been removed from OpenSSH,
      i.e.,<br /><br /> - RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library<br /> - IDEA is no longer included,
      its use is deprecated<br /> - DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library<br /> - GMP is no longer used, and
      instead we call BN code from OpenSSL<br /> - Zlib is now external, in a library<br /> - The make-ssh-known-hosts
      script is no longer included<br /> - TSS has been removed<br /> - MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL
      library<br /> - RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL<br /> - Blowfish is now external, in
      the OpenSSL library<br /><br /> [The licence continues]<br /><br /> Note that any information and cryptographic
      algorithms used in this<br /> software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major<br /> bookstore,

      Database<br /><br /> ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone<br />Database for its time
      zone support. The ownership of the TZ database<br />is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time
      Zone<br />Database section 7.<br /><br /> # 7. Database Ownership<br /> #<br /> # The TZ database itself is not an
      IETF Contribution or an IETF<br /> # document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work<br /> # that
      is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the<br /> # public domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and
      79 [RFC3979] do<br /> # not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make<br /> # to it. Should
      any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ<br /> # Database, the organization that is providing the
      IANA<br /> # Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of<br /> # understanding with the IETF,
      currently ICANN, may act in accordance<br /> # with all competent court orders. No ownership claims will be
      made<br /> # by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code. Any person<br /> # making a contribution to
      the database or code waives all rights to<br /> # future claims in that contribution or in the TZ
      Database.<br /><br />6. Google double-conversion<br /><br />Copyright 2006-2011, the V8 project authors. All
