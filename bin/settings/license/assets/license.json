It isolates the Function Driver from the specifics\n * of the controller by providing an API to the Function Driver.\n *\n * The Peripheral Controller Driver for Linux will implement the Gadget API,\n * so that the existing Gadget drivers can be used. (Gadget Driver is the\n * Linux terminology for a Function Driver.)\n *\n * The Linux Gadget API is defined in the header file\n * <code><linux/usb/gadget.h></code>. The USB EP operations API is defined\n * in the structure <code>usb_ep_ops</code> and the USB Controller API is\n * defined in the structure <code>usb_gadget_ops</code>.\n *\n * An important function of the PCD is managing interrupts generated by the\n * DWC_usb3 controller. The implementation of the DWC_usb3 device mode\n * interrupt service routines is in pcd_intr.c.\n */\np4://qctp411.qualcomm.com/components/rel/wlanfw_mac_core.cnss/1.0/src/soc/usbhwcore/drv/snps/pcd.c\n\n/* ==========================================================================\n * $File: //components/rel/wlanfw.cnss/1.0.1/cnss_proc/wlan/fw/target/include/usb3_hw.h $\n * $Revision: #3 $\n * $Date: 2013/08/06 $\n * $Change: 2161544 $\n *\n * Synopsys SS USB3 Linux Software Driver and documentation (hereinafter,\n * \"Software\") is an Unsupported proprietary work of Synopsys, Inc. unless\n * otherwise expressly agreed to in writing between Synopsys and you.\n *\n * The Software IS NOT an item of Licensed Software or Licensed Product under\n * any End User Software License Agreement or Agreement for Licensed Product\n * with Synopsys or any supplement thereto.
